  <!-- 30 watcher files -->
  
  <section class="doc">
    <h2>File #342-A: Origins</h2>
    <p>
      The entity known as <span class="redacted">The Watcher</span> began appearing in analog security feeds during ██/██/1978. 
      Victims described feelings of being watched, followed by progressive visual degradation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later sightings confirmed ███████ anomalies matching prior transmissions from <span class="redacted">Site-█</span>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="doc">
    <h2>File #487-B: The Signals</h2>
    <p>
      Unusual electromagnetic pulses were detected emanating from the ██████ forest on ██/██/1984.  
      These pulses caused intermittent blackouts and triggered intense paranoia among nearby residents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audio recovered from the area contains faint whispers, believed to be attempts at communication by <span class="redacted">The Watcher</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>File #512-C: Disappearances</h2>
    <p>
      Between ██/██/1991 and ██/██/1993, a series of unexplained disappearances were reported within a 10 km radius of <span class="redacted">Site-██</span>.  
      Witnesses claim to have seen shadowy figures and felt overwhelming dread prior to vanishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      No bodies or evidence were ever recovered, though local authorities noted a sharp increase in missing persons reports during this period.
    </p>
  </section>

      Devices display static, redacted images, or play unidentifiable audio fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attempts to decrypt transmissions resulted in personal data leaks and severe disorientation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="doc">
    <h2>File #754-F: The Red Eye</h2>
    <p>
      Eye witness accounts describe a glowing red orb observed hovering silently at night in ████████ woods.

  <section class="doc">
    <h2>File #958-J: The Redaction Protocol</h2>
    <p>
      Government documents relating to <span class="redacted">The Watcher</span> are heavily redacted.
